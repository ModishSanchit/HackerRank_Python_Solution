                                                           Beautiful Days at the movie


Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number , its reverse is . Their difference is . The number reversed is , and their difference is

.

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days,
and a number , determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where is evenly divisible by . If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the range.

    i = int(ijk[0])

    j = int(ijk[1])

    k = int(ijk[2])

    result = beautifulDays(i, j, k)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')
