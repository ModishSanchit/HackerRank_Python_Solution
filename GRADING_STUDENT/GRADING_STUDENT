                                                                    GRADING STUDENT



PROBLEM: HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

    Every student receives a 

in the inclusive range from to
.
Any
less than

    is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's

according to these rules:

    If the difference between the 

and the next multiple of is less than , round up to the next multiple of
.
If the value of
is less than

    , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example,
will be rounded to but will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than

.

Given the initial value of
for each of Sam's students, write code to automate the rounding process. 


Function Description

Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below. It should return an integer array consisting of rounded grades.

gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

    grades: an array of integers representing grades before rounding






SOLUTION:

#!/bin/python

import sys

def solve(grades):
    result = []
    for i in grades:
        if i >= 38:
            if i % 5 >= 3:
                i += (5 - i % 5)
        result.append(i)
    return result
               

n = int(raw_input().strip())
grades = []
grades_i = 0
for grades_i in xrange(n):
    grades_t = int(raw_input().strip())
    grades.append(grades_t)
result = solve(grades)
print "\n".join(map(str, result))
